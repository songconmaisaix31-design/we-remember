# Conversational Schedule Prototype — Technical Specification

## Architecture

The prototype is a dependency-free static web application:

- `app/index.html`: semantic page structure and product copy.
- `app/styles.css`: responsive layout, tokens, transitions, and reduced-motion handling.
- `app/app.js`: conversation state, deterministic draft extraction, confirmation, notification receipts, and browser speech capability handling.
- `scripts/verify_app.py`: structural contract checks that require no installed packages.

This is the shortest reliable path for validating the conversation and motion model while the repository has no established framework or package manager. It avoids choosing a production stack before identity, persistence, Agent, calendar, and notification boundaries are frozen.

## State model

```text
idle -> listening -> transcribing -> draft_ready -> confirmed
  |         |             |              |
  `---------+-------------+--------------`-> error
```

- `draft_ready` is non-consequential. It can be edited or discarded.
- `confirmed` appends one event and creates notification receipts.
- The prototype keeps state in memory and resets on reload.

## Voice behavior

When `SpeechRecognition` or `webkitSpeechRecognition` exists:

- Live dictation writes interim/final transcript into the composer and does not send.
- Voice message mode sends the final transcript after recognition ends.

When browser speech recognition is unavailable, controls enter an explicit unavailable state. Production uploaded-audio transcription uses `POST /api/transcriptions`; this static prototype does not fake that server result.

## Security and privacy

- Microphone capture begins only after a direct user gesture.
- The UI never reads credentials, browser storage, or private provider responses.
- Production input is untrusted at the API boundary and must be validated against the API contract.
- Agent output is a draft until a human confirms it.
- Notification recipients must be resolved to authorized identities server-side; display names are not authority.
- Logs must not contain raw audio or unnecessary transcript content.

## Motion rules

- Standard state transitions: 180–260 ms, ease-out.
- Draft entry: opacity plus an 8 px vertical offset.
- Card hover: at most `translateY(-4px)` with shadow change.
- Active voice: waveform amplitude and recording glow only.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables non-essential transitions and animation.

## Verification

```powershell
python -B scripts/verify_app.py
python -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/app/` and verify the primary journey in Chrome at 1440×1000 and 390×844, including overflow metrics and screenshots.
